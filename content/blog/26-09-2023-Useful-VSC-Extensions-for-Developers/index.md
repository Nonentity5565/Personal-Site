Welcome to my first blog!

After much contemplation and deliberation, I've decided to kickstart this blog with content that can prove beneficial to fellow developers. Please note that the tools and extensions mentioned here are presented in no particular order of importance or priority.

## 7. Auto Close Tag and Auto Rename Tag

[Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag) and [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag) are invaluable extensions that streamline the development process by simplifying tag creation and renaming. They prove especially helpful when dealing with renaming tags separated by extensive lines of code.

One minor inconvenience with Auto Close Tag is that it generates the closing tag next to the opening tag when creating a new one. This causes a slight disturbance when you want to wrap a portion of text in a new tag. You will need to manually relocate it to the desired position at the end of your content.

For example:

```HTML
<p>
  Below are the text that I want to wrap in a bold tag:
  ---example text to be wrapped in a bold tag---
</p>
```

```HTML
<p>
  Below are the text that I want to wrap in a bold tag:
  <b></b><= closing b tag automatically generated and needs to be
  manually moved
</p>
```

## 8. Color Highlight

![Color Highlight Demo](./img/ColorHighlight.png)

[Color Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight) is a small convenient extension that simplifies color management in your code. It automatically detects and highlights color codes in CSS, SASS, LESS, and more, providing real-time color previews.
